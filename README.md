This is a full stack example of using Next.js with Serverless Offline to just display my skills with React and Serverless communication.

This repository is made with the following:
- Material UI
- React
- Next.js
- Serverless

** Running the app **

It should be run via this command:
```yarn dev```

And the serverless should be run via
```yarn serverless```
